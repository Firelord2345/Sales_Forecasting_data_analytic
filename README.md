# Sales Forecasting

## Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model to forecast future sales based on historical data. By analyzing past sales data, we can predict future sales trends, helping businesses make informed decisions on inventory management, marketing strategies, and financial planning. The project is deployed as a web application using **Streamlit**, allowing users to interact with the model and view forecasts in an easy-to-use interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting.git
   cd sales-forecasting
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # For Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your historical sales data in CSV format with columns like:
   - `Date`: The date of the sale.
   - `Sales`: The number of units sold.
   - `Revenue`: Total revenue generated from the sales.

2. Run the Streamlit application to interact with the model:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. The Streamlit app will open in your web browser, where you can upload your data, select the forecasting model, and view the sales forecasts.

## Data

The dataset consists of historical sales data, typically structured as a time series. You can download example datasets from [here](#).

Ensure that the data contains sufficient historical sales records to train the model.

## Models

- **Time Series Models:**
  - **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)**: One of the most widely used models for time series forecasting.
  - **Prophet**: A forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is robust to missing data and can handle seasonality and holidays.
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A deep learning model that can be used for more complex, non-linear time series data.

## Evaluation

The model performance can be evaluated using metrics like:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

These metrics will help to assess the accuracy of the forecasted sales against the actual sales.

## Streamlit Deployment

The Streamlit application allows users to:
- Upload historical sales data.
- Choose different forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).
- View the sales predictions on a graph.
- Download the forecast results as a CSV file.

To deploy this app on your own server or cloud platform (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or Render), follow the [Streamlit deployment guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/deploy).
